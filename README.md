# Heartml: Ruby (WIP)

Server-rendered web components in Ruby using a SFC (Single-File Component) format loosely based on [HTML Modules](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/html-modules-explainer.md). Logic on the server-side is analogous to client-side logic provided by the Heartml web component library written in JavaScript.

Great for pairing with [esbuild-plugin-html-modules](https://github.com/hotmodule/esbuild-plugin-html-modules) for a full-stack component rendering pipeline.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add heartml

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install heartml

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bin/rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bin/rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
